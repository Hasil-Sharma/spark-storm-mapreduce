# Setting up N-Node hadoop cluster on EC2

Make sure you've private key for the ec2 instances, and security is configured such that you can access those ec2 instances.
Before proceeding setup trusted ssh between your local computer and between ec2 instances. Refer to script `setup_ssh_trust.sh` to get an idea how to do this.


In `constants.sh` mention all the AWS instances. The first instance runs ResourceManager and NodeManager. Rest all auto configured as slaves. Changing this behavior might lead to unprecedented load on nodes.

When you think ec2 is properly setup, change `$KEY` variable in `constants.sh`, and place your private key in this directory. This is required to setup ssh trust between ec2 instances.

After all this, issue following command:

``` bash
bash driver.sh setup_ssh_trust.sh download_hadoop.sh add_hadoop_variables.sh setup_core_site.sh setup_hdfs_site.sh setup_mapred_site.sh setup_slaves.sh setup_yarn_site.sh
```

After the script runs properly, login to master node (the first AWS instance you mentioned in `constants.sh`) `$HADDOP_PREFIX/bin/hdfs dfs -ls` will print the content of your root directory
